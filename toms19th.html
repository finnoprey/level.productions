          I hope you have a wonderful birthday because you really deserve it. But also a wonderful every day would be nice too, so I don’t want it to sound like wishing you a wonderful day just today is me wishing that you have a bad day every other day. Hope that clears things up.

          But seriously, I think you’re an incredible person and I’m so very fortuntate to know you as well as I do. In fact, reflecting back on our time together, I realise that I can’t actually recall any bad moments – only positive experiences in your company, which is a huge testament to your caring nature and wonderful personality.

          Everytime we are together I am reminded of how much we have in common and how much I should really hang out with you more. I remember the first time (I think) we met at the zoo excursion, and how well we got along then. I thought you were really cool and I was glad to meet someone new. Pity we barely spoke after that and it took us another few years to re-realise our compatability. But we got there, in the end.

          I want to mention TAPE 108 because I am so incredibly lucky to have had the opportunity to work on that project with you and I’m super proud of what we made. While I have made little projects in the past… TAPE 108 was very different in the sense that there was no choice but to stick through with it all the way to the end, even if that meant not sleeping for 40 hours straight or reducing scope by cutting some incredibly tedious rotoscoping jobs…

          The memories we made producing TAPE 108 are surely formative. From the many inspiring late night walks along Puckle Street to the chaotic but exhilerating shoot days, the cold mornings and long talks at school.. I am so grateful for the chance I had to collaborate with you on the film, and I can’t wait to continue to collaborate on projects in the future.
